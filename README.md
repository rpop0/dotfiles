# Introduction
This repository contains all of my custom dotfile configurations. Each tool is represented by a directory that has an `install.sh`
script and a file or directory containing the configuration.

The `install.sh` script backs up any existing configuration in the designated installation path and makes a Symbolic Link to
the installation path.
